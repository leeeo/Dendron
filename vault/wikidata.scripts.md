How cool would this be to have a script allowing to automatically fetch the wikidata link and id of any selected word.
This would clearly facilitate the addition of  wd links in manuscripts and documents. Such script could facilitate the use of wd while exploring a given topic. Ideally a small snapshot of the wd article could be displayed.
I have no idea of how doable this is.
Apperas cool to me at the moment (2021-03-13 00:17) might be full BS.

- [ ] check for similar plugins using google or wikipedia 
Make a small project out of this ? 
To discuss with Daniel.
