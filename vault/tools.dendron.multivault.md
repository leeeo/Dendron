Trying to implement a multivault setup after all because I would like to mange publishing and keep specific research project private or at least controled by pwd. For acces to specific collaborators wile other should be public.

Let's try this.

Starting here ... fell in a rabit hole.
The whole multivault and selective publication looks really tough ... for me at least.
I remember now why I turned away from it several times.

Digging this again.

Following https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/45cfb9f2-46cf-4f67-a41e-834818fbd06e.html


The `Dendorn: Initialize MultiVault Workspace` is not available 
So apparently this command is not existing anymore https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/790801646581055508

So in fact its Vault add  from a preexisting vault
