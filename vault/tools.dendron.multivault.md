Trying to implement a multivault setup after all because I would like to mange publishing and keep specific research project private or at least controled by pwd. For acces to specific collaborators wile other should be public.

Let's try this.

Starting here ... fell in a rabit hole.
The whole multivault and selective publication looks realy tough ... for me at least.
I rember now why I turned away from it several times.
